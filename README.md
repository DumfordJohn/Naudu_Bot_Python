### Day 1 (7/10/25):
Bot will accept reactions for tournament signups and split them into different matches.  I am able to choose the winner of the first match but unable to select a winner of any other matches.

### Day 2 (7/14/25):
Problem with the mulitple winners has been fixed, reaction role function based on each server, and twitch notification has been sent, tomorrow I need to make it so @everyone gets pinged.
